# JWT for Backdrop

This module adds the ability to create and authenticate JSON Web Tokens through global PHP functions. It is intended to facilitate developers wishing to integrate JSON Web Tokens into their projects.

## Installation

- Install this module using the official [Backdrop CMS instructions] (https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).
- (optional) Visit the configuration page under Configuration > Administration > Administer JWT Tokens.

## Usage

* `encode_jwt($payload_data, $expiration_in_seconds (optional))` -- Returns encoded JWT. Default expiration time is set on the settings page or can be specified with a second argument.

* `validate_jwt($jwt)` -- Returns false if JWT is invalid or expired, otherwise returns the decoded payload.

* `decode_jwt($jwt)` -- Returns false if JWT is invalid or expired, otherwise returns the decoded payload.
